# Simple Recipes

This datapack adds a few custom recipes for vanilla items. Many are inspired by similar recipes in other mods.

The motivation for these recipes is usually one of the following:

* Fewer steps for common crafting chains. e.g. Instead of craftings logs to planks and planks to chests, you can directly craft planks to chests.
* Reducing tedium. e.g. Gravel can be crafted into flint directly.
* Increasing availability of scarce decorative items. e.g. Combining netherrack with wart blocks produces nylium.
